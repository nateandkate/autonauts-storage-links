# Why is this on Github?
Although I enjoy coding and also Autonauts, this recent swap to event-based handling took a long time for me to complete. There is a lot of unsused code within the mod, and my hope is that someone who enjoys the mod will fork it, optimize it, and release it for many other players to enjoy.

# Changes required to Autonauts code
Note that this mod AS IS on this site WILL NOT WORK with the LIVE version of autonauts as of 2020-09-09. You will need to first obtain a copy of the DEV branch of Autonauts code, and then apply this DIFF file.
